	<h1>Franny's first website!</h1>
	
	<h2> Welcome to my new web page!</h2>
		<p>This is a place for me to practice using html to create stuff!</p>
		
	<h2> What I'm feeling right now: </h2>
		<p> I wish that it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlyXNRrsk4A">Friday! </a> </p>
		
	<h2> What's on this website:</h2>
		<p> The next two pages are dedicated to videos and cartoons that make me smile when I see them during the day. Hopefully they make you smile as well :) </p>
	
	<h2> About the creator:</h2>
		<p> Frances Stoneham was born in London, England. An avid reader, Frances also enjoys playing the ukulele and making fun of tv shows and movies. Contrary to some rumours, Frances has no interest in acquiring a neck tattoo, and never will.</p>
			
	<h2> Food for thought:</h2>
		<p>If a man says something in the forest, and there is no woman around to hear him, is he still wrong?</p>
